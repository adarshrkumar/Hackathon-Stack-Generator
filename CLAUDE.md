# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Astro-based web application (project name: "starry-saturn") using the minimal starter template. It's currently in early development (v0.0.1) and configured for the SCU AWS Hackathon Project.

## Development Commands

Run all commands from the project root:

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server at `localhost:4321`
- `npm run build` - Build production site to `./dist/`
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run astro ...` - Run Astro CLI commands (e.g., `npm run astro add`, `npm run astro check`)

## Architecture

This is a standard Astro project with the following structure:

- **src/pages/** - File-based routing. Each `.astro` or `.md` file becomes a route based on its filename
- **src/components/** - Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components (recommended location)
- **public/** - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.) served as-is
- **dist/** - Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)

### Configuration

- **astro.config.mjs** - Astro configuration (currently using default settings)
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript config extending Astro's strict preset
- Uses ES modules (type: "module" in package.json)

## Key Technologies

- Astro v5.15.1 (SSG/SSR framework)
- TypeScript with strict configuration
- File-based routing
